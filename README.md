Input method plugins for webOS. 

Plugins
=======
webOS uses maliit as IME framework. Maliit has framework-plugin architecture. So the input method plugins in this project are maliit plugins.

- `maliit-plugin-global`: This is an input method plugin for all languages webOS support except japanese and chinese.

- `skeleton`: This is a plugin with only warning logs in it. This is made as an example and will not be included in build. This may serve as a baseline for developers begin there work.

How to run maliit-plugins unittest
==================================
Test binaries will be installed as well as plugins unless disable-tests option is given.
